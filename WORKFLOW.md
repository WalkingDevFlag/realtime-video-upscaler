# Workflow for Enhancing Video Frame Quality and Frame Rate

### Step 1: Capture Video at 15 FPS
- Begin by capturing video footage at a frame rate of 15 frames per second (FPS).
- This step is crucial as it sets the foundation for the subsequent processing steps.

### Step 2: Upscale Every Other Frame Using a GAN
- Use a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for super-resolution to upscale the quality of every other frame.
- This step enhances the visual quality of the captured frames without processing all frames initially, maintaining efficiency.

#### Resources for GAN-based Upscaling:
- [Fast-SRGAN Repository](https://github.com/HasnainRaz/Fast-SRGAN)
  - A high-performance GAN model for super-resolution tasks, designed for speed and quality.

### Step 3: Generate Intermediate Frames to Increase Frame Rate
- Apply a frame generation algorithm to interpolate and create intermediate frames between the upscaled frames.
- This increases the video frame rate to 30 FPS or even 60 FPS, resulting in smoother motion.

#### Resources for Frame Generation:
- [Google Research Frame Interpolation](https://github.com/google-research/frame-interpolation)
  - A robust algorithm for creating high-quality intermediate frames.
- [TensorFlow Hub Film Model Tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub/tutorials/tf_hub_film_example)
  - A practical guide for using TensorFlowâ€™s FILM (Frame Interpolation for Large Motion) model.
- [Colab Example for Frame Interpolation](https://colab.research.google.com/github/tensorflow/docs/blob/master/site/en/hub/tutorials/tf_hub_film_example.ipynb#scrollTo=DQcWZm0FkPk-)
  - Step-by-step notebook demonstrating frame interpolation in an interactive environment.

### Summary
This workflow combines video capturing, quality upscaling via GANs, and frame interpolation to achieve enhanced visual quality and smoother motion in videos. By processing at an initial 15 FPS and leveraging advanced models, it ensures both efficiency and high-quality results.
